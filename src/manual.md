      Introduction
    id: intro
    text: |
      If you live in New Jersey, this Manual is for you. It is meant to help you and other New Jersey consumers, whether insured or uninsured, understand what your rights are when it comes to the cost of medical care and the burden of medical debt—to keep you from incurring medical debt in the first place, or help you reduce the amount of it, and to provide advice on how to deal with medical debt collectors and what to do if you are sued over a medical debt.  
      
      Even if you currently have no medical debt, and have—or think you have—good health insurance, all it takes is for you or a member of your immediate family to come down with a serious illness or chronic medical condition or be injured in an accident and you might find yourself joining the ranks of the estimated 100 million Americans who owe more than $220 billion in medical debt.* In New Jersey, there are 1.5 million residents struggling with medical debt.
      
      We cover topics such as the availability of financial assistance, out-of-network charges (which can lead to surprise medical bills), how to negotiate a payment plan, a new state law that prohibits the reporting of medical debt to the credit reporting bureaus, and what you can do if a medical debt is reported in violation of the law. We even explain the basics of how to read your health insurance card so that you can better understand your coverage, how to properly read a medical bill and when your insurer denies coverage or otherwise fails to pay the appropriate benefits under your policy, how to appeal that denial. And we discuss why you might be better off not using your credit card to pay for medical debt and why you also need to be careful about using medical credit cards like CareCredit or other specialized medical credit cards.  

      **We explain it all in non-technical, easy-to-understand language.**

      Throughout this Manual, there are links to websites containing additional information or forms which those who use this Manual online or in some other digital form can click on for ready access. For those, who print out the Manual on paper and cannot make use of the hyperlinks, we have provided the URLs (Internet addresses) in Endnotes at the end of each chapter.

      The Appendix provides important forms you can use to request an itemized bill, dispute charges with a medical debt collector and respond to a legal case filed against you in court for medical debt. It contains a list of Federally Qualified Health Care Centers in New Jersey, which provide care to everyone, regardless of ability to pay. If you are uninsured, fees are charged on a sliding scale based on your income. There is also information about how to find a lawyer if you need one, and possibly free legal services if you meet the financial criteria.

      **DISCLAIMER: The information in this Manual is not legal advice. It is a source of information to help New Jerseyans deal with medical debt. For legal advice, consult an attorney.**

      Chapter 1: Rights of Insured Patients
    id: chap1
    text: |
      For those who have health insurance of some kind – private insurance through your job or an individual policy bought on an insurance exchange, or through some public program like NJ FamilyCare, Medicaid or Medicare, this is for you.  Any kind of insurance is better than none, but policies differ not just in the monthly premiums you pay but also in: what benefits they provide and the scope of coverage, including the size of deductibles and co-pays; on pre-approval requirements; which providers are in or out of network; and what drugs are covered.

      Chapter 2: Rights of Uninsured Patients
    id: chap2
    text: |
      Without insurance, it can be difficult to get a physician to see or treat you, unless you seek services at the emergency room of an acute care hospital, where they are obligated by law to provide care. If you do not have health insurance, there are options available to you in New Jersey, where you may be able to receive affordable or even free health care as a “self-pay” patient.  Below, we will discuss options available to you.

      Chapter 3: What to Do When You Receive a Bill
    id: chap3
    text: |
      Whether or not you are insured, at some point after you receive health care services that are not fully covered by insurance or by Charity Care, you will receive a bill from the provider or providers involved in your treatment. Read below to learn how to read that bill, how to figure out if it is correct – both with regard to what it is charging you for and how much -- and, once you know how much you really owe, how to work out a payment plan with the provider so that you can pay the bill.  We will also suggest how to proceed if you cannot agree with the provider on the amount you owe, or if you disagree with a decision by your insurance company to deny coverage or erroneously treat the bill as out-of-network.

      Chapter 4: Understanding the Collection Process
    id: chap4
    text: |
      If your medical bill goes unpaid beyond its due date and if you are unable to negotiate a reasonable payment plan or you are challenging the accuracy of a medical bill, contesting the denial of benefits or the level of benefits paid by your insurance company, or simply can’t afford to pay the bill, the provider might send the bill to a collection agent, or sell your debt to a debt collection company which will try to get you to pay and sue you if you are not able to do so. Here is what you should know going forward.
